Also, there are some presets that you can use, with common number systems.

-   **üßÆ Calculator:** Based on the previously generated number system, you can make conversions from decimal to your own system, and from your own system to decimal.

-   **Your own system to decimal system:** In this option you have to input a value from your own numeric system (sequence using all or some of your digits), and it will return you the equivalent decimal number.
